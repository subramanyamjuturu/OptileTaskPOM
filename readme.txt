(Click on File which will be on the left side top corner in the eclipse >> click on import >> Select General option on the new pop-up box >> click on Existing Projects in workspace >> click on Next >> click on the Select root directory >> click on the Browse button >> Select the extracted project >> click on finish )
Install Testng in Eclipse by clicking on Help >> click on eclipse market place >> search TestNg and click on install

step 8: Click on windows, on the top of the eclipse which is placed next Help

step 9: Click on show view >> click on project Explorer

step 10: Double-click on the pom.xml and click on pom.xml which is placed next to Effective pom in newly opened window

step 11: Left click on the opened POM.xml >> click on Run as >> select maven install

step 12: Once maven install completes in the eclipse, Double-click on src/main/java in the opened Optile project under project explorer window in eclipse

step 13: Double-Click on com.Optile.Task and again Double click on OptileTask.java

step 14: Left click on the opened java code >> click on Run as >> click on Run configurations >> select project >> select suite and click on browse and select testng file which was placed under this project(execution starts now)

step 15: Once execution is completed, open the result path shown in the eclipse console

step 16: Follow below steps for opening the result in the datasheet
Result can be shown in Excel sheet(Data File) in the below format
to open data sheet please follow Path of the Data file in the project folder -\\OptileDataDriven\data\OptileTask\OptileTask_Data.xls
Open the excel file and click on Scenerio sheet, you can find the method names from the 2nd row under methodname column and click on results cell which is parallel to method names, Automatically result will be opened in a default browser in html format.

Results file Description:
•	On the top of result (i.e. in the Header session) we can find the Path of the result folder, execution date, execution time
•	Below to Header session we can find the Complete execution report with detailed description as follows
•	Detailed Description for execution report
	•	Module: This column indicates the execution steps
	•	Expected Value : This column indicates that what all expected things need to be done at that step
	•	Task : Kind of action indicates at that step
	•	Actual Value : This column indicates that what are the actual things present on UI
	•	Status : This column shows whether that step is pass or fail
	•	Pass or Fail :  By clicking on pass or fail, we can view the screenshot for reference
•	At the end of the report we can find execution end date, execution end time, overall time taken for execution

Note: The entire scripts are written in Selenium using java programming language, we can see the logic of the code by navigating to those methods (i.e.by pressing F3 key on that method in eclipse). 
The code is designed by taking following advantages into consideration:
•	Reusability of code
•	Hide the complexity of code
•	Customized detailed description of output result
